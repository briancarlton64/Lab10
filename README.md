# Lab10
In this lab the concepts concerning basic GUI and graphics inmplementation were covered. Basic drawing algorithms were implemented for basic geometric shapes such as simple polygons and ellipses.
All these shape implementations were drawn together and painted in a JPanel.
Of the choices of what to draw, I chose to think a bit creatively and animate my panel.
My program simply draws random shapes of random color of random size and position onto the panel.
The result is something that looks a bit like the 90's design, which is appropriate considering we are using Swing.
